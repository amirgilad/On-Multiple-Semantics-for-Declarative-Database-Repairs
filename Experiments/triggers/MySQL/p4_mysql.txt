# Encode the program:
# author|SELECT author.* FROM author, organization WHERE author.oid = organization.oid AND organization.oid = 16045;
# organization|SELECT organization.* FROM author, organization WHERE author.oid = organization.oid AND organization.oid = 16045;
# Result: 0.016 seconds. treated by the order the triggers were written, so if author trigger first, deleted authors, o.w. deleted a single org tuple
