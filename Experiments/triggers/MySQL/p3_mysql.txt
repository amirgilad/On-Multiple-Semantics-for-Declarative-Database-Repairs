# Encode the program:
# author|SELECT author.* FROM author, writes WHERE author.aid = writes.aid AND author.aid = 100920;
# writes|SELECT writes.* FROM author, writes WHERE author.aid = writes.aid AND author.aid = 100920;
# Result: 0.093 sec. Depending on the order of the triggers, either writes tuples are dleted if the writes trigger is written first or author tuples are deleted if it is the other way around
