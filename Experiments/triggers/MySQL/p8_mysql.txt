# Encode the program:
# author|SELECT author.* FROM author, writes WHERE author.aid = writes.aid AND author.aid = 100920;
# writes|SELECT writes.* FROM author, writes WHERE author.aid = writes.aid AND author.aid = 100920;
# publication|SELECT publication.* FROM publication, delta_writes, author WHERE publication.pid = delta_writes.pid AND delta_writes.aid = author.aid;
# publication|SELECT publication.* FROM publication, writes, delta_author WHERE publication.pid = writes.pid AND writes.aid = delta_author.aid;
# Result: 0.17 seconds. Treated like step semantics! if author triggers were first, deleted all author tuples and all publication tuples with the appropriate pid. O.w. deleted writes tuples and publication tuples associated with them.
